        "\n",
        "The environment used here is similar in spirit to the [T-Maze demo](https://pymdp-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/tmaze_demo.html), but the task structure is more complex. Here, we analogize the agent to a rat tasked with solving a spatial puzzle. The rat must sequentially visit a sequence of two cues located at different locations in a 2-D grid world, in order to ultimately reveal the locations of two (opposite) reward outcomes: one location will give the rat a reward (\"Cheese\") and the other location will give the rat a punishment (\"Shock\").\n",

        "Using active inference to solve a POMDP representation of this task, the rat can successfully forage the correct cues in sequence, in order to ultimately discover the location of the \"Cheese\", and avoid the \"Shock\"."

        "## Grid World Parameters\n",
        "Let's begin by initializing several variables related to the physical environment inhabited by the agent. These variables will encode things like the dimensions of the grid, the possible locations of the different cues, and the possible locations of the reward or punishment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having these variables defined will also come in handy when setting up the generative model of our agent and when creating the environment class.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will create a grid world with dimensions $5 \\times 7$. Particular locations of the grid are indexed as (y, x) tuples, that select a particular row and column respectively of that location in the grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "By design of the task, one location in the grid world contain a cue: **Cue 1**. There will be four additional locations, that will serve as possible locations for a second cue: **Cue 2**. Crucially, only *one* of these four additional locations will actually contain **Cue 2** - the other 3 will be empty. When the agent visits **Cue 1** by moving to its location, one of four signals is presented, which each unambiguously signal which of the 4 possible locations **Cue 2** occupies -- we can refer to these Cue-2-location-signals with obvious names: `L1`, `L2`, `L3`, `L4`. Once **Cue 2**'s location has been revealed, by visiting that location the agent will then receive one of two possible signals, that indicate where the hidden reward is located (and conversely, where the hidden punishment lies). These two possible reward/punishment locations are indicated by two locations: \"TOP\" (meaning the \"Cheese\" reward is on the upper of the two locations) or \"BOTTOM\" (meaning the \"Cheese\" reward is on the lower of the two locations).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this way, the most efficient and risk-sensitive way to achieve reward in this task is to first visit **Cue 1**, in order to figure out the location of **Cue 2**, in order to figure out the location of the reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Tip*: When setting up `pymdp` generative models and task environments, we recommend creating additional variables, like lists of strings or dicts with string-valued keys, that help you relate the values of various aspects of the task to semantically-meaning labels. These come in handy when generating print statements during debugging or labels for plotting. For example, below we create a list called `reward_conditions` that stores the \"names\" of the two reward conditions: `\"TOP\"` and `\"BOTTOM\"`"

        "Develop an active inference agent for a camping and foraging task within a custom grid world environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Environment Setup:**\n",
        "*   Define a grid (e.g., 6x8) with specific 'food' and 'shelter' locations, and a maximum hunger level (e.g., 3, representing levels 0-3).\n",
        "*   Assign random 'Low_Penalty' or 'High_Penalty' risk factors to non-shelter squares.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Generative Model Design:**\n",
        "*   **Hidden States:** Include `Location` (all grid points) and `Hunger Level` (0 to `max_hunger`).\n",
        "*   **Observations:** Define modalities for `Location Observation`, `Hunger Sensor`, `Square Type` ('Food', 'Shelter', or 'Normal'), and `Risk Feedback` ('None', 'Low_Penalty', 'High_Penalty').\n",
        "*   **`A` Matrix:**\n",
        "    *   `Location Observation`: Identity mapping for the location state factor.\n",
        "    *   `Hunger Sensor`: When at a 'Food' square, the observation should strongly predict 'satiated' (hunger 0), regardless of the true hunger state. Otherwise, it should perfectly observe the true hunger.\n",
        "    *   `Square Type`: Maps each grid location to its corresponding type.\n",
        "    *   `Risk Feedback`: Maps each grid location to its assigned risk feedback, with the 'shelter' always providing 'None' risk feedback.\n",
        "*   **`B` Matrix:**\n",
        "    *   `Location`: Transitions for 5 actions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, STAY).\n",
        "    *   `Hunger Level`: Generally increases by 1 per timestep, capped at `max_hunger`.\n",
        "*   **`C` Vector:** Set high positive preferences for low hunger observations (e.g., 'satiated') and 'None' risk feedback, and high negative preferences for high hunger observations and 'Low_Penalty'/'High_Penalty' risk feedback.\n",
        "*   **`D` Vector:** Initialize the agent's belief of starting at a specific location with an initial hunger level of 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Generative Process (`GridWorldEnv`):**\n",
        "*   Implement a custom `GridWorldEnv` class that accurately simulates the environment's true dynamics: tracking the agent's location, incrementing hunger over time (resetting to 0 when at a 'Food' square), and providing multi-modal observations based on the current environment state (including randomly assigned risk).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Simulation & Analysis:**\n",
        "*   Run an active inference simulation, tracking the agent's path and hunger over time.\n",
        "*   Visualize the agent's path through the grid world, indicating food/shelter locations, risk areas, and a timeline of hunger levels.\n",
        "*   Analyze if the agent's behavior successfully demonstrates an effective camping and foraging strategy based on hunger and risk avoidance."

        "The simulation ran for 10 timesteps, producing the following trajectory and hunger history:\n",
        "*   **Location History:** `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]` (11 locations for 10 timesteps)\n",
        "*   **Hunger History:** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2]` (11 hunger levels for 10 timesteps)\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Foraging Strategy:**\n",
        "    *   The hunger level indeed increases over time when the agent is not at a food square (e.g., from `t=0` to `t=3`, hunger goes from 0 to 3).\n",
        "    *   Crucially, the hunger resets to 0 at `t=4` when the agent is at `(1,1)`, and again at `t=8` when the agent is at `(1,3)`. The defined `food_location` for the environment is `(1,6)`. This indicates a significant discrepancy: the agent's hunger was reset *without* reaching the designated food location according to the environment's logic.\n",
        "    *   If we were to disregard this environmental anomaly, the agent's movement pattern (wandering when hungry, then \"finding\" a satiating location) could imply a foraging drive. However, due to the unexpected hunger resets, it's impossible to confirm if the agent was successfully foraging for food at the *intended* food location `(1,6)`. The agent did not reach `(1,6)` in this simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Camping/Risk Avoidance Strategy:**\n",
        "    *   The `shelter_location` is `(4,1)`. The agent's path in this 10-timestep simulation remains largely in the upper-left quadrant of the grid, never approaching the shelter.\n",
        "    *   The `risk_map` assigns random 'Low_Penalty' or 'High_Penalty' to non-shelter squares. Without knowing the specific risk values of the squares the agent traversed and those it avoided, it's difficult to definitively assess its risk avoidance strategy. The `C` vector's strong negative preferences for penalties suggest the agent should avoid high-risk areas. However, with the limited trajectory, we cannot conclude whether it actively avoided risky paths or sought the shelter (which provides 'None' risk).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "While the generative model and generative process were designed to support a camping and foraging strategy based on hunger and risk, the observed agent behavior in this 10-timestep simulation does not conclusively demonstrate the desired strategy due to a critical anomaly: the agent's hunger was observed to reset at locations `(1,1)` and `(1,3)`, which are not the designated `food_location` `(1,6)`. This implies either an inconsistency in the environment's hunger update during the recorded simulation, or a misalignment between the environment's true food location and what was used to update `history_of_hunger`. Without a simulation run that correctly reflects hunger resetting *only* at the `food_location`, a proper analysis of the foraging strategy is not possible. Similarly, the short trajectory prevents a clear assessment of its camping or explicit risk-avoidance behavior towards the shelter."
